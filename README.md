Implementation of [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06939.pdf)
### Todo:
- [X] Test ```grid_sample```
- [ ] Increase Batch size -> increase training time (need recheck)
- [ ] Make ```tools/model.py``` more readable
- [ ] Train the entire Unsupervised Network together instead of train ```GazeRepresentationLearning``` separately
- [ ] Change Angle Encoder
- [ ] Add warping field regularization
- [ ] Recheck division by batch size in feature loss
